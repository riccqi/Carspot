# Carspot
This is an iOS application made to help users in Singapore find the nearest available carparks with advanced search and navigation features.

This has been tested and works on iOS 14.2. After the first launch and accepting location services, please restart the app for the nearby carparks to show up.
This is a known bug that will only occur on first launch of the app, I am looking into fixing it.

For a rundown of all the features available in the app, please watch this video:

Thank you for checking this out and feel free to contribute to this project. I'm working on more updates in the meantime.
